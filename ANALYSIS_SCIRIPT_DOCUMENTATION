Documentation for Using data analytics scripts

Basic Company Info Scripts:

  company_info.py
    
    Given a ticker, this script will return a JSON file that holds the basic company information
    somone might want to know. Below is the json format and the items that are in basic company
    infromation. This will be added directly to ElasticSearch and only needs to be called once for 
    each company.

    Example "AAPL":
    {
      "AAPL": {
          "basic_company_info": {
              "name": "Apple Inc.",
              "description": "Apple Inc. designs, ... ... and is headquartered in Cupertino, California.",
              "sector": "Technology",
              "industry": "Consumer Electronics",
              "location": "Cupertino",
              "country": "United States",
              "founded_year": "N/A",
              "website": "https://www.apple.com"
            }
        }
    }

Price scripts:
  
  This script just returns the most recent closing price of a stock. This is used in many of the ratios and 
  techinal indicator. Also this would be good to display on the website. 

  stock_price.py 
    returns float stock price  




Fundamental Metrics scripts:

  These are going to use the financial statments to calculate many of the common ratios used for evaluating stocks
  This will output a json file that can be sotred in elasticsearch for later use. Only should be done once for 
  new data.

  fundamental_metrics.py 

    will return json with info
    WORKING ON IT

Technical Metric scripts:

  This is also going to output a json that could be ingested into elastic search. This is encompass technical analysis
  metrics just as beta, moving averages, RSI... Although this can be ingested into elastic search, this information
  changes on a more frequent basis. Is there a better way of handling it.

  technical_metrics.py 

    will return json with info
    WORKING ON IT

Financial statement scripts: 

  There are three scripts for each of the finanial statments a company releases.
  Using each of these scripts with the ticker and the item we wish to fetch, we can get the most recent
  items. These items are not gaurnteed to be listed on all companies, if so the scirpts will return "N/A"
  If the items does exists it will return a float value of the item. We must then check that this does
  not return N/A if we are calling it. For now all the information is fetched form quarterly reports.
  For income statements and cash flow statments the values are generally a summation of the each of the listed 
  values for the last 4 quarters poseted. Thus these values are TTM (trailing 12 months) and are the most 
  accurate depiction of how the company is doing. Balance sheet is just a singular value that depicts a 
  snapshot in time therefore there are no TTM or AVG values.

  I hope to possibly implemenent scripts that go over annual reports and get a moving avereage of larger 
  metrics like revenue, debt, cash flows. Using matplotlib we could also give these metrics grahpical 
  representaiton.
